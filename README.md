## üìå Project Overview

This project performs an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a dataset containing statistics of trending YouTube videos. The goal is to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that help understand what makes videos go viral, how viewers engage with content, and which factors contribute to high performance.

The dataset typically includes features like view count, like count, dislike count, comment count, duration, upload date, channel information, and more. Through visualization and statistical analysis, this project aims to provide actionable insights for content creators, marketers, and researchers interested in understanding the dynamics of YouTube's trending ecosystem.

## üß† Objectives

- Understand the structure and quality of the dataset.
- Identify key factors influencing video performance (e.g., views, likes, comments).
- Explore correlations between different metrics (e.g., view count vs. like ratio).
- Visualize trends across categories, channels, and time periods.
- Detect outliers or anomalies in the data.
- Provide actionable insights for content creators and marketers.

## üîç Key Activities Performed

1. **Data Loading & Inspection**
   - Checked shape, data types, missing values, and duplicates.

2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handled missing values using imputation or deletion.
   - Removed irrelevant columns.
   - Converted categorical variables if necessary.
   - Renamed columns for clarity.

3. **Descriptive Statistics**
   - Summarized numerical and categorical variables.
   - Identified min/max/mean/std values for key metrics.

4. **Univariate Analysis**
   - Distribution plots (histograms, KDEs) for metrics like view count, like count, and comment count.
   - Bar charts for top-performing categories or channels.

5. **Bivariate/Multivariate Analysis**
   - Scatter plots to explore relationships (e.g., view count vs. like ratio).
   - Heatmap for correlation between ranking parameters.
   - Boxplots to compare metrics by category or channel.

6. **Visualization Highlights**
   - Top N videos by view count, like count, and engagement rate.
   - Trends in video performance over time (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly).
   - Regional distribution of popular content.

7. **Insights and Observations**
   - Which categories dominate in terms of views and engagement?
   - How do video duration and upload time affect performance?
   - Are there specific days or times when videos tend to perform better?
